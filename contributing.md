You can send a pull request if you find a lecture is missing, or a lecture is wrongly included.

- lecture wrongly included: Strike it through (like e.g. Patterns in Software Engineering)
- lecture missing: Add a line on the second sheet with the INxxxx code and the lecture name. Then re-apply the the filter on the first sheet, cell J3. The lecture should appear either under an area of specialization, or at the bottom if it's not in the official elective modules table.

Please re-generate the pdf afterwards by exporting columns A-H as pdf.
